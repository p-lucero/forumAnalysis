    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The two articles and their respective forums have vastly different goals and achieve them in similarly different ways. The readership of <em>Nature</em> is mostly those who are research scientists themselves, although there is a subset of the audience that may be more interested in the current events content. With <em>ScienceAlert</em>, the audience is most likely entirely composed of those who are casually interested in science. Likewise, the scholarly forum has no advertisements on its pages and survives through grants and donations, whereas the popular forum is mostly advertisements. The way in which the content is presented is also highly different, as <em>Nature</em>'s content is far more dense and formal, whereas <em>ScienceAlert</em> is far more conversational. This is reflected in the quality of the vetting process of the authors; the scholarly journal is very strict about which authors are allowed to publish, and the popular forum does not require as many qualifications and accolades from its authors.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">Despite their differences, there are also considerable similarities between the two forums. The subject matter discussed within each has some similarities, as they both discuss scientific research or science-related topics. It is arguable that there is some overlap in the purpose of their articles, as both have articles that primarily exist to get people excited about science. Both are seeking to draw in new viewers with interesting content, and to gain an ever-growing reader base. This serves overall to demonstrate that, even though there are certain differences between the forums, they both have somewhat of the same overall goal in the landscape of the web.</p>

    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/breaking-a-brand-new-type-of-qubit-has-been-unveiled-and-it-finally-makes-quantum-computers-scalable">article within the popular forum</a> provides a somewhat low-level summary of the data and findings in the corresponding article in <em>Nature</em>. The graphs and data-heavy approach of a scholarly article are absent, as are the equations that define how the results were obtained. The purpose of the article is essentially to draw views, not unlike the other articles in the popular forum. The title starts out strong, with &quot;An Entirely New Type of Quantum Computing Has Been Invented&quot;. However, it's not so much a new type of quantum computing as it is a new building block for quantum computers, and it hasn't been invented so much as theorized. The article even later admits as much:</p>
    <blockquote>To be clear, so far we only have a blueprint of the device - it hasn't been built as yet. But according to team leader, Andrea Morello, the development is as important for the field as the seminal 1998 paper in Nature by Bruce Kane, which kicked off the silicon quantum computing movement.<cite>Fiona MacDonald/Mike McRae</cite></blockquote>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The important rhetorical moves of this article are those that make it accessible to a mainstream audience: relatively short paragraphs and sentences, absence of technical terminology, a video summary for those who prefer to avoid reading, and a focus on the story of the individuals that are creating the thing rather than the research itself. The purpose of this article seems designed to generate shares and reposts, so that an individual will be drawn in by the fascinating but unexplained image that heads up the article, then share the article with their friends so that their friends will continue to generate clicks and ad revenue for the site. The article does a decent job of explaining the challenges of making a quantum computer in spite of this, but never really delves into what it is that a qubit does, or why it is so important that the qubit has been redesigned.</p>

    </center>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The tone of this particular article isn't as casual as <a href="/forumAnalysis/popforum.html">others in this forum</a>, but it still succeeds at being far more informal than the article in <em>Nature</em> itself. A considerable portion of the article's text is also quotations, which are drawn essentially verbatim from an interview that the authors of the paper did in another popular journal. All of this serves to make viewers within the popular domain interested without telling them much of anything about the admittedly dense field of study that the information comes from.</p>

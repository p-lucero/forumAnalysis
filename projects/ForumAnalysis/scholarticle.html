    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00378-x">central article</a> to this analysis concerns quantum computers. More particularly, it concerns the way in which these quantum computers store data, something called a qubit. The word is essentially a merging of &quot;quantum&quot; and &quot;bit&quot;, and refers to the mechanism that stores a single binary data point inside of a quantum computer. This is essentially the crux of quantum computing: storing a single bit requires quite a lot of complicated infrastructure, which is very difficult to miniaturize effectively without breaking the quantum entanglement that makes the computer quantum. This article proposes a way to effectively miniaturize this storage, although it does not provide a working prototype so much as it provides a theory of how to create one.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The purpose of the article is essentially to convince other scientists in the field that this technique is indeed viable and valuable, and that miniaturization of a quantum computer in this way is possible. The majority of the article is taken up by sections detailing the results of this particular study, with plenty of graphs and data visualizations that aren't particularly helpful unless one knows exactly what one is looking at. These graphs are most likely aimed at someone who has extensive knowledge of quantum computing and is likely to be familiar with the terminology going in.</p>
    <blockquote>In conclusion, we have presented a way to encode quantum information in the electron-nuclear spin states of 31P donors in silicon, and to realize fast, high-fidelity, electrically driven universal quantum gates. Our proposal provides a credible pathway to the construction of a large-scale quantum processor, where atomic-size spin qubits are integrated with silicon nanoelectronic devices, in a platform that does not require atomic-scale precision in the qubit placement.<cite>G. Tosi et al.</cite></blockquote>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">Since this article is targeted at someone who is already entrenched in the field with its graphs, terminology, and equations, it is most likely intended to convince those who are in the field that the research within the article provides a viable way to construct a larger-scale quantum computer, and perhaps even to convince them to use the methods detailed in the article when constructing a quantum computer in the future. It's unlikely that this article is intended to excite anyone who is not actively researching quantum computing, such as those in the popular field who might be casually interested in it, or those who might be interested in funding it for their own purposes rather than for the sole purpose of advancing the field.</p>

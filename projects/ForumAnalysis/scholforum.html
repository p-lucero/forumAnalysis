    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;"><em>Nature</em> is arguably one of the most
    well-known journals, possibly in part due to its status as an interdisciplinary journal. An <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002">announcement from 2012</a> claims that the journal has a readership of greater than 3 million unique readers per month, which has probably grown in the years since the announcement. Another factor is potentially the relative accessibility of some of their articles. Although articles such as the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00378-x">topic of this particular analysis</a> are relatively inscrutable to the average individual, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/">home page of the site</a> contains a selection of titles such as &quot;The economics of excrement&quot; and &quot;What the eyes tell the brain&quot; which are much more easily digestable than &quot;Transplantation: CXCL10 linked to poor outcomes&quot; and other titles in the lower Research section of the page.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">Although the purpose of <em>Nature</em> is arguably to report research results, it's not as convincing that this is the case from its homepage. Most of the titles near the top of the page are concerned with material that is accessible to individuals outside of the field, as well as individuals that are not researchers at all. There's also a prominent &quot;Current Events&quot; section that is positioned before the research section, which contains titles that have little if anything at all to do with research. The front page also contains a striking amount of photography and images that one might expect to find in a newspaper.</p>

        <li><a class="th" href="/forumAnalysis/images/naturemain.jpg"><img src="/forumAnalysis/images/naturemain_400px.jpg" data-caption="A screenshot of the headlines of Nature."></a></li>
        <li><a class="th" href="/forumAnalysis/images/naturecomms.jpg"><img src="/forumAnalysis/images/naturecomms_400px.jpg" data-caption="A screenshot of the headlines of Nature Communications."></a></li>
      </ul>
    </center>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">home page for <em>Nature Communications</em></a> tells a somewhat different story. Rather than newspaper-style images and articles about current events, research takes center stage on this page. There is a &quot;Trending&quot; section near the bottom of the page, but all of the headlines in this section are still concerned primarily with research. Clicking on a link to an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00730-1">example article</a> non-central to this analysis serves to demonstrate the pattern of full texts complete with jargon and graphs of data that are likely to be confusing to outsiders of the field.</p>

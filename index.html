    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">This Forum Analysis project concerns itself with analyzing
      content from two very different soruces: the <a href="https://www.nature.com"><em>Nature</em> journal</a>
      (in this particular case, <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>,) which covers a 
      wide range of topics across the entirety of the sciences, and the somewhat less professional popular journal
      <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com"><em>ScienceAlert</em></a>, which brings the content of more scholarly journals like
      <em>Nature</em> down to a more easily understandable level. In particular, the topic here is quantum computing, one of the
      current forefronts of research within the field of computer science along with such other topics as artificial intelligence, 
      robotics, and neural networks.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">However, quantum computing in particular differs from the rest of the above-mentioned topics in a variety of important ways.
      The first and foremost way is that it is much more intimidating; the fact that it has the word "quantum" in the name ties it
      to such fields as quantum mechanics and quantum physics, typically regarded as more confusing or difficult than average.
      In this, there is some truth, as quantum computing is essentially quantum mechanics applied to computing and therefore more
      difficult to understand. The myth of difficult is somewhat unnecessarily perpetuated by the way in which quantum computing is
    discussed - that is, as more of a nebulous concept than something that has any sort of real-world applications.</p>

      <a class="th" href="/forumAnalysis/images/quantumcomputingoverview.jpg"><img src="/forumAnalysis/images/quantumcomputingoverview_400px.jpg" data-caption="A general idea of the possible applications of quantum computers vs. regular computers."></a>
    </center>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">The articles in question each deal with a new development in the field of quantum computing that may elevate it from the
      above-discussed nebulous concept into something that may see real-world deployment sometime in the foreseeable future. Currently,
      quantum computers are far smaller in scale than anything typically termed a &quot;computer&quot; in the modern world; modern
      quantum computers are more concerned with being able to factor very small numbers (usually two digits or less) than being able to
      perform sophisticated tasks like render web pages or play video. However, as discussed in the other links on this page (see the
    top bar) the two articles treat the subject matter in altogether different ways.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">For the reader that would like to read the articles themselves, they are provided here: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00378-x">the article in <em>Nature</em></a> and <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/breaking-a-brand-new-type-of-qubit-has-been-unveiled-and-it-finally-makes-quantum-computers-scalable"> the article in <em>ScienceAlert</em></a>.</p>

    <p style="padding-top:60px; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">Although not quite as well-known as Nature, <em>ScienceAlert</em> isn't that small of a site, with its <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/sciencealert.com">Alexa ranking</a> placing it in the top 10,000 global websites, with several hundred thousand visitors per day. Its readership also differs greatly from Nature, something which is clear from both the article headlines and the sensationalist tone. One of its leading stories at the time of research was <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-discovered-how-to-make-alcohol-out-of-thin-air">&quot;Scientists Have Discovered a Way to Make Alcohol Out of Thin Air&quot;</a>. The leading few sentences also tell quite the interesting story:</p>
    <blockquote>Friends, the utopia is real. Researchers say they have a way to make alcohol out of thin air, and the technique might even save the world in the bargain, not just our rent money.

Now before you start organising your weekend around this bubbly fantasy, the alcohol we're talking about here is more than just the stuff in your drink, and the thin air it's made from is actually heavy â€“ clogged with heat-trapping pollutants that are wrecking Earth's atmosphere.<cite>Peter Dockrill</cite></blockquote>
    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">Like many websites nowadays, the title leads the reader in with a very appealing premise, then reveals that it's not entirely everything that it's made out to be in the title. Although the article does a decent job of explaining why, it's still somewhat deceptive. This writing style ties into their greater fundamental purpose, which is to serve ad-space. With an ad-blocker turned on, about two dozen of the web requests that <em>ScienceAlert</em> makes are blocked, and the number of total advertising related web requests increases at least two-fold when the end user decides not to block ads. The impact on the site's appearance is also clear, as at least half a dozen unique advertisements sandwich themselves between the paragraphs. This is in direct contrast to <em>Nature</em>, which does not load any advertisements on any of its pages.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:5em; text-align:justify;">However, in spite of the fact that the purpose of this journal is very clearly to sell advertisements, they do a decent job of providing some quality content behind all of the flashy images and vapid headlines. The article in question is more than just a two-line summary, and does a good job of linking to other sources so that a reader can choose to investigate further into what is being said rather than taking it at face value. The authorship of the articles is not entirely clear at first glance, however. The profiles of the authors are buried within a somewhat-hidden &quot;Our Team&quot; page in the right-hand sidebar, making it relatively unlikely that any of the readers will enquire as to who is writing the articles.</p>
